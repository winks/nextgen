# nextgen

A static site generator in Rust.

Built to see how much code is really needed to replicate [my website](https://f5n.org) that is built with hugo.

The result are 333 lines of code (282 NCLOC) and using 6 crates.

[Here's a detailed writeup](https://f5n.org/blog/2020/a-static-site-generator/) about the development.
